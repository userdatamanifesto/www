			<h2>
				<strong>Control</strong><br/>
				over user data access
			</h2>

			<p>Data explicitly and willingly uploaded by a user should be under the ultimate control of the user. Users should be able to decide whom to grant direct access to their data and with which permissions and licenses such access should be granted.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section knowledge">
			<img src="knowledge.svg" alt="" />
			<h2>
				<strong>Knowledge</strong><br/>
				of how the data is stored
			</h2>

			<p>When the data is uploaded to a specific service provider, users should be informed about where that specific service provider stores the data, how long, in which jurisdiction the specific service provider operates, and which laws apply.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section freedom">
			<img src="freedom.svg" alt="" />
			<h2>
				<strong>Freedom</strong><br/>
				to choose a platform
			</h2>

			<p>Users should always be able to extract their data from the service at any time without experiencing any vendor lock-in. Open standards for formats and protocols are necessary to guarantee this.</p>
