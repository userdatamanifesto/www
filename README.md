# user data manifesto 2.0

Last year, Frank published the userdatamanifesto.org He asked for
comments, reviews, and feedback.

We acknowledge that today, computers, networks and online services
are complex. The days where personal computing only happened on
personal computers are long gone (if they ever really existed).
This isn't an excuse for accepting that our rights and freedom be
violated. It behooves us to demand freedom on the Internet and to
refuse  feudalism. 

This is why we want to improve the User Data Manifesto to define
the basic rights all users of Internet and Web services ought
to have.

Please join us in writing this document. Feel free to fork, edit,
