# user data manifesto 2.0

Last year, Frank published the userdatamanifesto.org He asked for
comments, reviews, and feedback.

We acknowledge that today, computers, networks and online services
have socially complex implications. The days where personal
computing only happened on personal computers are long gone (if
they ever really existed).  This isn't an excuse for accepting
that our rights and freedom be violated. It behooves us to demand
freedom on the Internet and to refuse  feudalism. 

This is why we want to improve the User Data Manifesto to define
the basic rights all users of Internet and Web services ought to
have.
