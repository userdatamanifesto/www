defining basic rights for people to control their own data in the
internet age

1. Own the data

    The data that someone directly or indirectly creates belongs
    to the person who created it.

2. Know where the data is stored

    Everybody should be able to know: where their personal data is
    physically stored, how long, on which server, in what country,
    and what laws apply.

3. Choose the storage location

    Everybody should always be able to migrate their personal data
    to a different provider, server or their own machine at any
    time without being locked in to a specific vendor.

4. Control access

    Everybody should be able to know, choose and control who has
    access to their own data to see or modify it.

5. Choose the conditions

    If someone chooses to share their own data, then the owner of
    the data selects the sharing license and conditions.

6. Invulnerability of data

    Everybody should be able to protect their own data against
    surveillance and to federate their own data for backups to
    prevent data loss or for any other reason.

7. Use it optimally

    Everybody should be able to access and use their own data at
    all times with any device they choose and in the most
    convenient and easiest way for them.

8. Server software transparency

    Server software should be free and open source software so
    that the source code of the software can be inspected to
    confirm that it works as specified.
