"> I have previously characterized this model of computing as \"feudal.\" "
"Users\n"
"> pledge their allegiance to more powerful companies who, in turn, promise "
"to\n"
"> protect them from both sysadmin duties and security threats. It's a "
"metaphor\n"
"> that's rich in history and in fiction, and a model that's increasingly\n"
"> permeating computing today.\n"
"> \n"
"> Medieval feudalism evolved into a more balanced relationship in which "
"lords\n"
"> had responsibilities as well as rights. Today's Internet feudalism is "
"both\n"
"> ad-hoc and one-sided. Those in power have a lot of rights, but "
"increasingly\n"
"> few responsibilities or limits. We need to rebalance this "
"relationship. In\n"
"> medieval Europe, the rise of the centralized state and the rule of law\n"
"> provided the stability that feudalism lacked. The Magna Carta first "
"forced\n"
"> responsibilities on governments and put humans on the long road toward\n"
"> government by the people and for the people. In addition to re-reigning "
"in\n"
"> government power, we need similar restrictions on corporate power: a new\n"
"> Magna Carta focused on the institutions that abuse power in the 21st "
"century.\n"
"> \n"
"> Today's Internet is a fortuitous accident: a combination of an initial "
"lack\n"
"> of commercial interests, government benign neglect, military requirements "
"for\n"
"> survivability and resilience, and computer engineers building open "
"systems\n"
"> that worked simply and easily.\n"
"> \n"
"> We're at the beginning of some critical debates about the future of the\n"
"> Internet: the proper role of law enforcement, the character of "
"ubiquitous\n"
"> surveillance, the collection and retention of our entire life's history, "
"how\n"
"> automatic algorithms should judge us, government control over the "
"Internet,\n"
"> cyberwar rules of engagement, national sovereignty on the Internet,\n"
"> limitations on the power of corporations over our data, the ramifications "
"of\n"
"> information consumerism, and so on.\n"
"> \n"
"> Data is the pollution problem of the information age. All computer "
"processes\n"
"> produce it. It stays around. How we deal with it -- how we reuse and "
"recycle\n"
"> it, who has access to it, how we dispose of it, and what laws regulate it "
"--\n"
"> is central to how the information age functions. And I believe that just "
"as\n"
"> we look back at the early decades of the industrial age and wonder how\n"
"> society could ignore pollution in their rush to build an industrial "
"world,\n"
"> our grandchildren will look back at us during these early decades of the\n"
"> information age and judge us on how we dealt with the rebalancing of "
"power\n"
"> resulting from all this new data.\n"
